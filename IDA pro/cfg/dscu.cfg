// dscu will track regions of the cache that are not covered by any of the modules.
// such regions can be the result of changes in the dyldcache format, and they might
// contain useful information that we might want to load into the analysis.
//
// however small gaps in the address space are very common, for instance between
// sections of different modules or alignment bytes. to avoid tracking thousands
// of tiny inconsequential gaps, we only track gaps of substantial size.
//
// you can change the given minimum size to load smaller gaps if necessary.
